#Problem 1: Flights at ABIA

#### For this problem, our group created visuals that presented the odds of departure delay based on various features. 
##### Couple of things to note:
###### We included all departure delays (any flight that had a positive value under the 'DepDelay' column) in our plots
###### We calculated the "Odds of Delay" by dividing the number of delayed flights (those that met the condition specified above) of a given category by the total number of flights of that category.

#Problem 3: Practice with Association Rule Mining

#####***Revisit the notes on association rule mining, and walk through the R example on music playlists: [playlists.R] and [playlists.csv].  Then use the data on grocery purchases in [groceries.txt] and find some interesting association rules for these shopping baskets.  The data file is a list of baskets: one row per basket, with multiple items per row separated by commas -- you'll have to cobble together a few utilities for processing this into the format expected by the "arules" package.  Pick your own thresholds for lift and confidence; just be clear what these thresholds are and how you picked them.  Do your discovered item sets make sense?  Present your discoveries in an interesting and concise way.***

```{r}
detach(package:tm, unload=TRUE)
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```

#####**First, we read in the groceries.txt file and save it in a format which the arules package can read and work on**

```{r}
groceries=read.transactions(file="groceries.txt",rm.duplicates=TRUE,format="basket",sep=',')
```

#####**Next, we plot an item frequency plot which basically tells us which items are the most frequent and these are the ones we would be focussing on, since they will hold quite a lot of interesting relationships with other items which occus less frequently**

```{r}
itemFrequencyPlot(groceries,topN=10,type="absolute")
```

#####**Obtaining the different association rules by setting the support to 0.001 and the confidence to 0.85.**

```{r}
groceryrules <- apriori(groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.001, conf = 0.85))

summary(groceryrules)
```

#####**We can see that 4and 5 itemgroups are the most common with our threshold**
#####**There are 199 association rules for our given threshold**

```{r}
plot(groceryrules)
```

#####**The above plot shows us the relationship between the confidence, support and lift for our 199 itemgroups**

#####**Here are some of those associations**

```{r}
inspect(subset(groceryrules,subset=lift>5))
```

#####**We see that the rules are not sorted. We usually want the most relevant rules first. We can easily sort by confidence to get the most likely result.**

```{r}
groceryrules<-sort(groceryrules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)

inspect(subset(groceryrules,subset=lift>5))
```

#####**It is seen that if you buy liquor and red/blush wine, there is an approximately 11 times higher chance that you would buy bottled beer. This does not come as a surprise and it also shows that you might have a drinking problem**
#####**It is also observed that when oil, other vegetables, tropical fruit, whole milk and  yogurt are bought together, the customer has a very high chance of buying root vegetables, indicating that they are going to have a dinner party at home with proper mealsand desserts**
#####**It is also observed that when cream cheese, curd, other vegetables and whipped/sour cream are bought together, yogurt is bought too. This seems interesting that a person picking up so many dairy products doesn't seem to pick up whole milk. He is probably lactose intolerant, and can only have substitutes for milk, which is what the other dairy items might be made out of**

#####**Next we see a group plot of the Items in teh LHS and RHS of the rules**

```{r}
plot(groceryrules, method="grouped")
```

#####**Here, the darker the color, higher is the lift and the bigger the circle is, the more support**

#####**Now that we know how to generate rules, limit the output, we can now target items to generate rules. What this means is we want to set either the Left Hand Side and Right Hand Side.**

```{r}
groceryrules<-apriori(data=groceries, parameter=list(support=0.001,confidence = 0.15,minlen=2), appearance = list(default="rhs",lhs="whole milk"),control = list(verbose=F))

groceryrules<-sort(groceryrules, decreasing=TRUE,by="confidence")

inspect(groceryrules)
```

#####**We can now visualise what is "whole milk" most associated with. The bigger the Circle,the more the support.**

```{r}
plot(groceryrules,method="graph",control = list(nodeCol = grey.colors(1), edgeCol = grey(.3),alpha = 1),interactive=FALSE,shading=NA)
```

#####**Alternatively, we can also visualise the relationships in the following way** 

```{r}
plot(groceryrules,method="graph",control = list(nodeCol = grey.colors(1), edgeCol = grey(.3),alpha = 1,layout=igraph::in_circle()),interactive=FALSE,shading=NA)
```

#####**A couple of observations we can make from these results and corresponding visualizations are:**
#####**If you buy whole milk, you are almost 1.5 times more likely (looking at the lift values) to buy other vegetables, yogurt, root vegetables and tropical fruits. Also, you are less likely to buy soda if you have bought whole milk. This shows that you are a health conscious person who likes to stay healthy and eat all types of foods so that you can get all types of nutrients.**

# REMOVED R CODE
